see the basic distributions of pits : number of pits accor to sex.
number of pits as a function of age.
standard deviation as a function of the depth.
etc.

function(nodes involved for a specific function align in proximity) and geometry(same size brain should be closer.) use of attention to inject assumption.



Processing HCP: list of step to 

Monday 10AM meeting with Guillaume.



See for a group of subject the visualizations - 

-T-test on the distribution of male and females.
-distrinution for number of male and female nodes.
-To know how hard is the classification problem.

- Hot topic: Brain age of from the representation.

- ABIDE on the server, - > learn representations.
- Guillaume is working extracting the graphs for ABIDE.

-The cortical thickness changes with age, the volume also.
-The brain flattens with age.
-Cortical thickness per basin as a feature can be used.

-Gender prediction with unregistered data, to check the impact of registeration.

-Two method to compute the mean graph by FX.
-One based on matching-KerGM and other optimal transport.
-Could be an easy way to have an ISBI paper.

Start overleaf with a structure, introduction with why sulcal pits is relevant for learning representation.(refer to, Deep learning encodes robust discriminative neuroimaging representations to outperform standard machine learning).

Next friday meeting with all.
